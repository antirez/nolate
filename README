Nolate - NO LAme TEmplate system

OVERVIEW
--------

Nolate is a template system similar to erb that is designed for not consuming
some huge amount of CPU without a good reason. It is written in pure Ruby.
Nolate is distributed under a two clause BSD license for max freedom.

Templates can include code inside <%= %> that is evaluated with eval() and
substituted to the string.

Also occurrences of <%#something%> are substituted with the value of the
hash field :something of an additional hash passed to nolate() or nlt()
functions.

IS IT SUPER FAST?
-----------------

Fast enough that a small template substitution is not measurable by the
apache benchmark against a sample Sinatra application.
Surprisingly this is not as common as it should be.

HOW TO USE IT?
--------------

Nolate consists of just three functions. The first is nolate() that is the core
of the template system:

    nolate("The sum is <%= 2+2 %> Also substitute <%#myfield%> ok",
           {:myfield => 10})

The array is optional, if you don't have <%#%> style substitutions you can
simply omit it.

The second function is nlt(), and is used to also handle loading the template
from a 'views' directory. The above example can be translated using nlt()
just creating a file 'views/index.nlt' with the following content:

The sum is <%= 2+2 %> Also substitute <%#myfield%> ok

Then we can use nlt() calling:

    nlt("index.nlt", {:myfield => "something"})

the nlt() funciton will take care to cache templates into memory.
In order to flush this templates to force reloading just call the third and
final provided function:

    nlt_flush_templates()

It is possible to pass the template name as a symbol like in:

    nlt(:index)

nlt will add ".nlt" at the end of the name when it is a symbol.

SUPPORTED SUBSTITUTIONS
-----------------------

<%= somecode %>     Evaluates somecode and substitutes the return value.
<% somecode %>      Evaluates somecode.
<%#filed_name%>     Substituted the value of the specified filed of the hash
                    passwd to nolate() or nlt() as optional argument.

It is possible to interleave template and Ruby code together like in the
following example:

<% (0..5).each{|x| %>
<li><%=x%></li>
<% } %>
